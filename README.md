# Brest_cancer_prediction_api

Making a api for brest cancer prediction using pickle and flask

The dataset is taken from kaggle 

## Dataset Explanation 

- 1) Contains Medical information about different peoples
- 2) Contains Information regrding the brest tissue
- 3) Dataset is nomalized & nearly balanced
- 4) Since it is a medical data, generating more points is not good practice

## About the model

- 1) Triend Different algorithms to make a model
- 2) The balancing was not a problem in any model
- 3) Finally xgboost gave the best results

## The Conclusion

- 1) Finally making a API with flask
- 2) Loaded the model and applied same preprocessing as the training
- 3) The form was created and it was doing good predictions

## Limitations

- 1) In order to apply it globally we need more data
- 2) For the balacing issue a neural network approach can lead us to much better reult
- 3) An Image model and this model can both  work together for some really good predictions
